            <p>It is a very simple internet-shop. Basically I implemented all valible functionality in couple hours, so don't judge too strict.</p> 
            <p>I started it as a challenge, can i or not create public shopping cart with out cookies. And I assume I nailed it. 
                Of course,  if you reload a page you will lost all products from the cart, but  you have to pay for everything, 
                as one guy once said.  </p> 
        </div>
